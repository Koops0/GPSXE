This is a work-in-progress Sony PlayStation emulator project coded in the Go programming language, aimed at providing a platform to run PlayStation games on modern hardware.

#### Disclaimer: This emulator project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. or its subsidiaries. It is developed independently and aims to provide a means for enthusiasts to experience PlayStation games on modern platforms. Furthermore, I DO NOT support piracy in any way, unless there's some hidden game that costs more than a $70 USD/$90 CAD PS5 title (at that point, you're getting ripped off). If you want to dump your .iso legally, the [emulation wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Ripping_games#Sony_PlayStation_1.2F2) has you covered.
